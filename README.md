# Eldritch

This repo revives the "Eldritch" project made in the Fall 2016 semester of HUMAN-1050.

Specifically, it modifies the repo so that it deploys on Github Pages successfully. Also, links are changed so no 404 errors are encountered.

The original README of this project had no contents, so nothing was deleted from this file when copying over the project files.

The original project repo, if you're interested, is hosted here: https://github.com/PPH3/Eldritch
